# Welcome to Maison Inspect

## What's Maison Inspect?

Maison Inspect is a Ruby on Rails application to create, track and share inspection reports for Homes.

Typically, when a real estate unit (condo or house) is sold, a building inspector visits the location, performs routine checks, takes notes and pictures, then proceeds
to return to his or her office and creates a pdf file to share with the Home Owner or prospective buyer.

This is a tedious process where information may be lost. This app helps solve the issue.
